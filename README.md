This is a Python port of the SED fitter from Robitaille et al., 2006, ApJS 169 328

At this stage, it should be used cautiously as it is still beta-quality software and may contain bugs. Please make sure that you verify your results using an independent method if at all possible (for example using the fitting tool from http://caravan.astro.wisc.edu/protostars/ which uses an independent Fortran code).
