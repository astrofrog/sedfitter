Fitting SEDs to sources
=======================

Typical workflow
----------------

Once the data has been prepared following the description in :doc:`data`, and
that you have a set of models in the format described in :doc:`model_packages`
the typical workflow to follow when using the SED fitting tool is:

* Fit a given set of models to the data
* Optionally split the output between well- and badly-fit sources
* Make plots of the SED fits, or of the parameter distribution

Each of these steps can be performed by one ore more functions in the SED
Fitting tool, which are described below in detail:

Note on quantities and units
----------------------------

The Python SED fitting tool makes use of the :mod:`astropy.units` package to handle
units and unit conversions. Several of the options that need to be specified in
the functions described below require :class:`~astropy.units.quantity.Quantity`
instances. Defining quantities is straightforward::

    from astropy import units as u

    # Define scalar quantity
    q1 = 3. * u.kpc

    # Define array quantity using a list
    q2 = [1., 2., 3.] * u.arcsec

    # Define array quantity using a Numpy array
    q3 = np.array([1., 2., 3.]) * u.cm ** 2 / u.g

Fitting the models to the data
------------------------------

In order to fit the data, you will need to make use of the
:func:`~sedfitter.fit` function, which can be imported using::

    from sedfitter import fit

At a minimum, you will need to call the function with the following input:

* The file containing the data (see :doc:`data`).
* The list of filters and aperture radii for which the data is given (see :doc:`filter_names`).
* The directory containing the models (see :doc:`common_model_packages` and :doc:`creating_model_packages`).
* The name of the output file
* The range of Av and distances to assume for the fits
* An extinction law, given as a opacities to extinction (in cm^2/g or equivalent) versus wavelength.

The :func:`~sedfitter.fit` page describes in detail how each of these inputs
should be specified, and also lists additional options to further fine-tune the
fitting and the output.

The following is a complete example showing how to use the
:func:`~sedfitter.fit` function::

    from astropy import units as u
    from sedfitter import fit
    from sedfitter.extinction import Extinction

    # Define path to models
    model_dir = '/Volumes/Data/models/models_r06'

    # Read in extinction law)
    extinction = Extinction.from_file('kmh94.par', columns=[0, 3],
                                      wav_unit=u.micron, chi_unit=u.cm**2 / u.g)

    # Define filters and apertures
    filters = ['2J', '2H', '2K', 'I1', 'I2', 'I3', 'I4']
    apertures = [3., 3., 3., 3., 3., 3., 3.] * u.arcsec

    # Run the fitting
    fit('data_glimpse', filters, apertures, model_dir,
        'output.fitinfo',
        extinction_law=extinction,
        distance_range=[1., 2.] * u.kpc,
        av_range=[0., 40.])

.. note:: in the filter list, you can also specify wavelengths as Astropy
          :class:`~astropy.units.Quantity` instances. If you do this, the SED
          wavelength closest to that specified will be used in the fitting.

.. note:: if you do not specify the columns and units when reading in the
          extinction, the first two columns are read and are assumed to be in
          c.g.s.. If you have previously used the Fortran version of the SED
          fitter, you will need to specify ``columns=[0, 3]`` to choose the
          first and fourth column.

Plotting SEDs
-------------

Once you have fit the data, you will likely want to plot the resulting SED
fits. To do this, you will need to make use of the :func:`~sedfitter.plot`
function, which can be imported with::

    from sedfitter import plot

The :func:`~sedfitter.plot` requires the output file from the
:func:`~sedfitter.fit` function as well as the name of an output directory. For
example, continuing the example above, you can do::

    from sedfitter import plot
    plot('output.fitinfo', 'plots_seds')

By default, only the best-fit parameter is shown, but this can be changed by
using the ``select_format`` option, which is described in more detail in
:doc:`select_syntax`. For example, to write out all the models with a
:math:`\Delta\chi^2` value per data point (relative to the best fit) of less
than 3, you can do::

    plot('output.fitinfo', 'plots_seds', select_format=('F', 3))

In addition, there are many options available to
customize the format and appearance of the plots. For more information about
these options, see the :func:`~sedfitter.plot` page.

Plotting parameters
-------------------

Functions are available to make 1- and 2-d parameter plots::

    from sedfitter import plot_params_1d, plot_params_2d

As when `Plotting SEDs`_, one needs to specify the output file from the
:func:`~sedfitter.fit` function, the output directory, and the name of the
parameters to plot::

    from sedfitter import plot_params_1d, plot_params_2d

    # Make histograms of the disk mass
    plot_params_1d('output.fitinfo', 'MDISK', 'plots_mdisk',
                   log_x=True)

    # Make 2-d plots of the envelope infall rate vs disk mass
    plot_params_2d('output.fitinfo', 'MDISK', 'MDOT', 'plots_mdot_mdisk',
                   log_x=True, log_y=True)

By default, only the best-fit parameter is shown, but this can be changed by
using the ``select_format`` option, which is described in more detail in
:doc:`select_syntax`. In addition, there are many options available to
customize the format and appearance of the plots. For more information about
these options, see the :func:`~sedfitter.plot_params_1d` and
:func:`~sedfitter.plot_params_2d` pages.

Splitting well- and badly-fit sources
-------------------------------------

After computing the fits with :func:`~sedfitter.fit`, it is possible to split
the output file on the basis of the :math:`\chi^2` value for the best-fit. This
is done using the :func:`~sedfitter.filter_output` function which is imported
with::

    from sedfitter import filter_output

For example, to split the above file into well- and badly-fit sources based on
the absolute :math:`\chi^2` of the best-fit, you can do::

    filter_output('output.fitinfo', chi=3.)

This will produce files named ``output_good.fitinfo`` and
``output_bad.fitinfo`` by default (although you can also specify custom
names for the output files). It is also possible to split the fits based on the
:math:`\chi^2` value per datapoint using the ``cpd`` option. More information
about the available options is available in :func:`~sedfitter.filter_output`.

Extracting the fit and model parameters
---------------------------------------

The output files produced above are in binary format and are not
human-readable. To produce ASCII files of the output, you can use the
:func:`~sedfitter.write_parameters` and
:func:`~sedfitter.write_parameter_ranges` functions. The former is used to
write out all the parameters of all the models requested, while the latter will
only write out the minimum and maximum for each parameter. The functions are imported with::

    from sedfitter import write_parameters, write_parameter_ranges

To use these functions, you will need to specify the input binary file, and the
output ASCII file name::

    from sedfitter import write_parameters, write_parameter_ranges

    # Write out all models with a delta chi^2-chi_best^2 per datapoint < 3
    write_parameters('output.fitinfo', 'parameters.txt',
                     select_format=('F', 3.))

    # Write out the min/max ranges corresponding to the above file
    write_parameter_ranges('output.fitinfo', 'parameter_ranges.txt',
                           select_format=('F', 3.))

More information about the available options is given in
:func:`~sedfitter.write_parameters` and
:func:`~sedfitter.write_parameter_ranges`.
